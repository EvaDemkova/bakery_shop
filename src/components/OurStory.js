      <p>
        We are a bakery with a purpose. And we’re passionate about the food we
        create. We’ve been in business for over 10 years, and we’ve been feeding
        our community of patients, employees and customers with a smile, through
        hospitality, passion, and good old-fashioned hospitality. We’re a
        wholesaler that prides itself on being a one-stop shop for all your
        baking needs, and we’re excited to be a part of this community.
